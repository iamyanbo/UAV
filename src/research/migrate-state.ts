/**
 * Moving a project's state directory to the current name.
 *
 * The directory cannot simply be renamed. Two things record where it is: the
 * store keeps absolute attempt and workspace paths, and git registers every
 * worktree by absolute path in `.git/worktrees`. Renaming the directory without
 * updating both leaves a store pointing at paths that no longer exist and a set
 * of worktrees git considers broken.
 *
 * So this is a migration with an order that matters — move, rewrite, repair —
 * and it refuses to run while anything is live, because a supervisor mid-attempt
 * holds open handles and would write the old paths straight back.
