/**
 * Keeping the published record level with the live one.
 *
 * `research publish` is a one-shot: it snapshots the record at the moment it is
 * invoked. That made the public mirror silently wrong rather than merely stale —
 * a snapshot taken during a pause showed a paused direction for as long as
 * nobody re-ran the command, so a reader could not tell a finished direction
 * from an un-republished one.
 *
 * The record is therefore republished from the supervisor itself, on a timer,
 * whenever the direction has actually changed. Publishing is skipped entirely
 * when no event has been appended since the last one, so a quiet direction costs
 * nothing, and a failure to reach Firestore is logged and retried at the next
 * tick rather than being allowed to end the research run.
