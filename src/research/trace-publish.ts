/**
 * Publishing agent traces without publishing the machine that produced them.
 *
 * A trace is the most informative part of a run — the reasoning, the code the
 * agent wrote, the checks it ran — and it is also the part most likely to carry
 * something personal, because tool output is whatever the machine printed. The
 * two are not separable by inspection: a stack trace embeds a home directory, a
 * failed request can echo a key, `git log` carries an email address.
 *
 * So the boundary is not a scrub, it is a verification. Text is redacted first,
 * and then *checked* against identifiers taken from the running environment —
 * the actual username, hostname, home directory, and the value of every
 * credential-shaped variable. A step whose text still contains one of those is
 * withheld rather than published. A pattern this module fails to anticipate
 * therefore costs a missing step, never a leak, and the withheld marker makes
 * the omission visible instead of silent.
 *
 * Tool *output* is withheld by default even when it passes: it is unbounded
 * machine output rather than research, so publishing it is an explicit choice
 * (`--with-tool-output`) rather than something a default turns on.
