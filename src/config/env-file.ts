 * the real environment always beats the file. On Cloud Run there is no `.env`
 * in the image and configuration arrives as service environment variables or
 * Secret Manager references, so this call is a no-op there; locally it saves
 * exporting keys by hand into every shell that starts a daemon.
 *
 * The file is therefore a developer convenience, never a deployment artefact.
 * It must stay untracked: a committed `.env` would both leak credentials and
 * silently shadow nothing, since the environment wins anyway.
