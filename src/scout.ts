/**
 * Literature scout: a perpetual watcher for work related to the campaign.
 *
 * Runs alongside a campaign and never inside it. The manager deliberately has
 * NO tools - its context packet is its whole world - so the scout cannot be a
 * tool the manager calls. It is a separate process that writes into `sources`,
 * and the packet surfaces what it found. That separation is what keeps the
 * manager's inputs reproducible: every cycle can be replayed from a packet that
 * was written to disk, including whatever literature was known at the time.
 *
 * ## Fetched text is data, never instructions
 *
 * This is the one genuinely new attack surface in the system. Everything else
 * the harness reads is either its own output or a candidate diff it treats as
 * hostile by default. Paper titles and abstracts come from an open API that
 * anyone can post to, and they end up inside a model's context.
 *
 * So the scout:
 *   - stores only title, URL, date and abstract - never full text, never HTML
 *   - strips control characters and collapses whitespace
 *   - clips hard, so a long injected payload cannot dominate the packet
 *   - neutralises the obvious framing tricks (fenced blocks, role headers)
 *   - marks every record `reliability = 'lead'`, never 'primary'
 *
 * A lead is a pointer to read something, not evidence. Nothing the scout writes
 * can support or refute a claim on its own: promoting a lead to evidence
 * requires a human, exactly as the autonomy ladder says A4 requires.
 *
 *   usage: tsx src/scout.ts --campaign cuda-001 --query "cuda softmax kernel"
 *                           [--every 3600] [--once]
